# Apply the given template to ALL pages below the section, recursively.
# If you have several nested sections each with a page_template set, the page
# will always use the closest to itself.
# However, a page own `template` variable will always have priority.

# No pagination will happen if this isn't set or if the value is 0

# For example the default would be page/1
# paginate_path = "page"

# Whether to insert a link for each header like the ones you can see in this site if you hover one
# The default template can be overridden by creating a `anchor-link.html` in the `templates` directory
# Options are "left", "right" and "none"

# Whether the section pages should be in the search index. This is only used if
# `build_search_index` is set to true in the config

# Whether to render that section homepage or not.
# Useful when the section is only there to organize things but is not meant
# to be used directly

# Whether to redirect when landing on that section. Defaults to not being set.
# Useful for the same reason as `render` but when you don't want a 404 when
# landing on the root section page.
# Example: redirect_to = "documentation/content/overview"

# Whether the section should pass its pages on to the parent section. Defaults to `false`.
# Useful when the section shouldn't split up the parent section, like
# sections for each year under a posts section.

   <p>I will be starting in the fall as a <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/fellowships/nasa-hubble-fellowship-program/2024-nhfp-fellows#section-ff92d8dd-2af7-410e-8be0-c5501f8227f1" target="_blank">NASA Hubble Fellow</a> in the <a href="https://web.astro.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Astrophysical Sciences</a> at <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Princeton</a>, working at the intersection of astrostatistics, data science, and the interstellar medium. 
   
   <strong>My research focuses on combining astrophysics, statistics, and high-performance coding to study the chemical, spatial, and kinematic variations in the dust that permeates the Milky Way.</strong> This dust is an important building block in matter assembly (formation of stars and planets), driver of the interstellar environment, and Galactic foreground. To do this, I use spectroscopic and imaging surveys containing millions and billions of stars, respectively.</p>

   <p>I am passionate about scientific communication, open source software/data availability, and the replication crisis. I am also a Julia programming language enthusiast. Please reach out to me if you want to collaborate or have any questions related to my research!</p>

   <p>In previous careers, I have also been a chemist (spectroscopy, organometalic, polymers) and condensed matter physicist (InAs/HgCdTe superconductor-semiconductor fabrication and dilution refrigerator measurement) and have deeply loved each of these roles.</p>
