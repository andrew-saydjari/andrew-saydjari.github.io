For me, one of the main motivations for doing science is my own curiosity, to answer the neverending stream of questions I have about the world around us. I believe it is part of our responsibility to share that knowledge and answer the public's questions as well, working hard to explain without condescension or oversimplificaiton. I find doing so energizing, when you can engage with other people and get them excited about your own obsessions, and centering, reminding me what the big questions are that I am after. To that end, I dabble in popular science writing, some examples of which are on <a href="https://mathstatbites.org/author/andrew-saydjari/" target="_blank">MathStatsBites</a>:  <a href="https://mathstatbites.org/pulling-patterns-out-of-data-with-a-graph/" target="_blank">TheSequencer</a>, <a href="https://mathstatbites.org/bridging-the-gap-between-models-and-data/" target="_blank">CycleStarNet</a>, <a href="https://mathstatbites.org/mathstatbites-at-scma8-astro-image-processing-is-bliss/" target="_blank">SCMA8</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17_a9zdjH-vvjkuBv5lfE0vjq7FaCWL-PnA5Soy9L-LU/edit" target="_blank">NestedSampling</a>.

I am passionate about teaching and enjoy developing new materials to explain hard concepts. I love seeing a concept “click” when an explaination works best for a given student’s understanding. My favorite part about teaching is 1-1 student interaction, which feels like the most concrete way I can improve the climate and culture of academia, by lifting up one student at a time. I believe that getting to know students as people is the best way to understand and resolve conceptual gaps. And of course, every time I teach a concept I learn something myself either from great student questions or in the course of refining and improving examples or analogies.

        Short Biography

</h3>

I was raised in <a href="https://www.wirapids.org/" target="_blank">Wisconsin Rapids, WI</a>, a small midwestern town with "good people" and my loving cat. During my time at <a href="https://www.wrps.org/schools/lincoln/" target="_blank">Lincoln High School</a> I fell in love with chemistry and started spending my summers researching at the <a href="https://www.nrl.navy.mil/" target="_blank">US Naval Research Lab</a> working on photosensitive polymers and spectro-electrochemistry with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/blake-simpkins-07a4566/" target="_blank">Blake Simpkins</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/walter-dressick-b9b1a32a/" target="_blank">Walter Dressick</a>. After graduating in 2014, I went to <a href="https://www.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Yale</a> where I immersed myself in the chemistry curriculum, <a href="https://thz.yale.edu//" target="_blank">terahertz pump-probe spectroscopy</a>, and managed to unlearn a vehement dislike for physics. I spent productive summers working on polymer chemistry for origins-of-life at the <a href="https://centerforchemicalevolution.com/" target="_blank">Center for Chemical Evolution</a>, Georgia Tech and solar cells at <a href="https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/en/home" target="_blank">MPIP</a> in Mainz, Germany. During undergrad was the first time I saw the beauty of mathematics and realized that condensed matter physics was like taking the infinite limit of chemistry. As it happens, Yale also introduced me to another kind of beauty, my partner. We bonded over shared curiosity and short-stories (<a href="https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/kritzer_01_15/" target="_blank">Cat Pictures Please</a>). 

In 2018, I completed my Bachelor of Science with Honors in Mathematics, and dual Bachelor/Master of Science in Chemistry with a thesis on <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscatal.9b00566" target="_blank">organometallic catalysis</a>. I also completed a thesis in Physics on fabrication of suspended Josephson junctions, advised by <a href="https://appliedphysics.yale.edu/michel-devoret" target="_blank">Michel Devoret</a>. Spurred by this work, I started my graduate studies in the <a href="https://www.physics.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Physics</a> at <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard</a> working on topological superconductivity 

Outside of work, I enjoy biking, fantasy and science fiction audiobooks, and curling up my cat. I am a member of several fandoms and strongly believe that Voyager is the best Star Trek series.
