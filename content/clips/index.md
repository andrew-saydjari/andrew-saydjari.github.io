The easiest way to get a sense of a researcher is sometimes just to watch them give a talk about their work. Here are some of mine, including an accessible interview.

## CloudCovErr @ ITC Lunch, Harvard

{{ youtube(id="ExNehaKDfVI?si=4iQI-gf1xISOfshV&amp;start=1189") }}

## GaiaDIB @ CHASC, Harvard

{{ youtube(id="nJp4Bmsy8UE?si=c9eBiEibI8je1UO-&amp;start=98") }}

## DECaPS2 @ AstroByNight

{{ youtube(id="6arJ34boVSo ") }}


Beyond this, we received significant press for the DECaPS2, which is a credit to the whole team. A selection of those articles are linked on the press section of my [CV](/files/CV_saydjari.pdf).
